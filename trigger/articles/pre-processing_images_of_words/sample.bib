    abstract="Most OCR (Optical Character Recognition) systems developed to
        recognize texts embedded in multimedia documents segment the text into
        characters before recognizing them. In this paper, we propose a novel
        approach able to avoid any explicit character segmentation. Using a
        multi-scale scanning scheme, texts extracted from videos are first
        represented by sequences of learnt features. Obtained representations
        are then used to feed a connectionist recurrent model specifically
        designed to take into account dependencies between successive learnt
        features and to recognize texts. The proposed video OCR evaluated on a
        database of TV news videos achieves very high recognition rates.
        Experiments also demonstrate that, for our recognition task, learnt
        feature representations perform better than hand-crafted features.",
